      <p>My name is Nate Trainor, a Colorado full-stack developer. My interest in computer
        programming stemmed from my interest in program modification and learning new languages. I received a full-stack
        education at Skill Distillery, where I learned Java, SQL, HTML,
        CSS, JPQL, and other programming languages. Despite the program's rigor, my established work ethic enabled me to
        fully immerse myself into Java to pass Oracle's <a
          href="https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-808#exam-details"
          target="_blank">Java SE 8 Programmer I (1Z0-808)</a> exam.</p>

      <br>

      <p>For the past three years, I have been working in SysOps, DevOps, and CI/CD
        environments. As a DevOps programmer outsourced to Comcast Voice Provisioning,
        I built the monitoring/alerting framework for our cloud applications, implemented Layer 7 and circuit breaker
        infrastructure through Java and Spring,
        created the JUnit test framework utilizing secure OAuth 2.0 api’s testing, and provided
        documentation and knowledge transfer sessions for all of the above.
        At Dish Network, I gained experience with SecOps cloud management as I was one of the lead developers creating
        applications to enter and investigate its Amazon Web Services infrastructure.
        Despite having little prior experience with AWS, I took this challenge head on. Now, I have two certifications
        for both <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/"
        target="_blank">basic cloud practice</a>  and <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/"
        target="_blank">systems administration</a> to truly test my knowledge of AWS. Now, at United Launch Alliance,
        I have dipped my toes into CI/CD by constructing and refactoring Bamboo pipelines to provide fast, secure code deployments
        for development teams. Throughout my short career, I have gained the praise and recognition from my peers and managers,
        with even a few raises along the way.</p>

      <br>

      <p>These years of experience have been beneficial in both increasing my programming language knowledge,
        my understanding of the software development process and best practices, and my
        ability to work on a professional Agile team. I look forward to working with you, and feel free to look at
        my previous projects below or contact me. Thank you for visiting!</p>

      </a>
      <p class="left"> My group midterm project at Skill Distillery, ideas. was the first full-stack project created
        from scratch, from the creation of the MySQL database to the JSP pages. The user can read ideas and comments,
        but cannot make any ideas or comments themselves
        until they create an account or login. With the notable exception of some security issues, our group was able to
        account for full CRUD functionality, admin privileges, comprehensive sorting logic, and multiple like prevention
        for a single user.</p>

        <h3 class="rightHeader">SEVEN WONDERS</h3>
      </a>
      <p class="right"> An individual project, Seven Wonders was one of my later fully dynamic web projects. Users are
        able to not only read files from the database, but create, update, and delete files as well, making this a
        functional CRUD application. Unlike some of
        my earlier projects, this was my first project that integrated all of my previously learned technologies, both
        HTML and CSS on the front-end, and SQL, Gradle, Spring and JPA in the back-end.</p>

      </a>
      <p class="left"> Similar to my Seven Wonders project, ACME Electric Billing enhances the CRUD experience through
        the usage of REST API construction and JavaScript implementation.
        Through the usage of REST routes and an API, the process of CRUD operations runs much cleaner and more
        efficiently behind the scenes in the back-end, even thoguh the user does not see this.
        What the user does see is the convenience of performing CRUD operations on a single page through JavaScript,
        with aggregate data displays that update with each operation the user performs.</p>

      <p class="right"> One of my later projects at Skill Distillery, US State Finder was one of my early full-stack
        projects combining database interaction with MySQL with front-end user interface with HTML. The user can either
        retrieve state data by name or abbreviation,
        and the program displays information about the state, including Google Maps location for the capital and a link
        to the state's Wikipedia page.</p>

      <p class="left"> My first encounter with regular expressions, Roman Numeral Translator takes a user's numerical
        input and converts it to a Roman numeral.
        Although certainly a challenge, my lab partner and I were able to work together in pair-programming to deliver a
        completed product.</p>

      <p class="right"> One of my early advanced Java programs that operates with class and method interaction. It
        utilizes enums to create the deck of cards which is used in the game of blackjack against the computer. A
        highscore .txt file can also score the highest score
        of rounds won.</p>
